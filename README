This project is for experimenting with the network characteristics in real situations (practice), not in theory.

All the scripts are ordered alphabetically by adding the number before the name.

1. First you need to create you experimental workong directory and run *install-keys.sh
to identify you in the future on all the servers.

2. Then it's necessary to install following packages (by running *init.sh as root):
	bittorrent
	openssh-client
	nginx
	vsftpd
	wget

############ Your experimental files are:
############ 1024.bin.torrent
############ 1024.bin

----------------------------------TORRENT EXPERIMENTS-------------------------------

3. Next step is to generate some random files using /dev/urandom as a source and list
of sizes from the sizes.sh. It is doing by *generate.sh script

4. The torrent protocol uses .torrent metafiles for work. The script *optimal-size.sh ???########3
generates such files

5. Simple torrent is tested by *torrent.sh and it is not written yet.

-------------------------------------FTP EXPERIMENT----------------------------------

6. Ftp get is tested by *ftp-dedicated.sh 

------------------------------------HTTP EXPERIMENT----------------------------------

7. http is tested *http-dedicated.sh. It is not written yet.

-------------------------------------GRID EXPERIMENT----------------------------------

8. grid-ftp is tested by *grid-tcp-dedicated.sh and it is not written yet.

9. grid-udp is tested by *grid-udt-dedicated.sh and it is not written yet.
